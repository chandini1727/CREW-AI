# CREW-AI
## Project Overview
This is a simple Python project that reads and explains PDF files, like technical reports. It uses AI to find text, tables, and charts in PDFs, then makes them easy to understand. It creates graphs, saves results, and lets you ask questions about the PDFs.
## Key Features

 - Checks if PDFs are okay (not too big, have enough text).
 - Reads text and images from PDFs.
 - Saves PDF data to work faster next time.
 - Uses six AI helpers (agents) to:
      * Study the PDF content.
      - Pull out tables and numbers.
      - Understand charts.
      - Write a short summary.
      - Give useful ideas.
      - Answer your questions.
 - Makes line and bar graphs from PDF data.
 - Saves results and graphs as files.
-Lets you ask questions about the PDF.
